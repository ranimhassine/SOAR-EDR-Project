# SOAR-EDR Project

The **SOAR-EDR Project** integrates **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** capabilities with **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** systems. This project demonstrates how automation, orchestration, and endpoint protection can work together to streamline incident response and threat management in a cybersecurity workflow.

---

## Features

- Integration of SOAR platforms with EDR systems for efficient incident handling.
- Automated threat detection, investigation, and response workflows.
- Examples of custom playbooks for handling common security incidents.
- Log correlation, alert prioritization, and automated remediation.

---

## Use Cases

- **Threat Detection and Response**: Automatically identify and respond to endpoint threats.
- **Incident Management**: Streamline and automate repetitive security tasks using SOAR playbooks.
- **Log Analysis**: Correlate logs and alerts from multiple sources for better threat intelligence.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate with enterprise-level EDR and SOAR tools.

---

## Prerequisites

- **SOAR Platform**: Ensure access to a SOAR solution like [Splunk Phantom](https://www.splunk.com), [Cortex XSOAR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/xsoar), or others.
- **EDR Solution**: A supported EDR platform such as CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **Python**: Required for running scripts or integrations.
- **APIs**: Ensure API access to both your SOAR and EDR platforms.
- A basic understanding of security automation and EDR workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nattycoder/SOAR-EDR-Project.git
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your API keys and endpoints in the provided configuration file (`config.json` or `.env`).

---

## Usage

1. **Set Up API Integrations**:
   - Update the configuration file with your SOAR and EDR API credentials.
   - Test the connectivity using the provided test script.

2. **Run Playbooks**:
   - Choose or customize a playbook to meet your security needs.
   - Execute playbooks via the SOAR platform or directly using the scripts:
     ```bash
     python playbooks/<playbook_name>.py
     ```

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Analyze the outcomes of automated actions.
   - Fine-tune playbooks or configurations to better suit your environment.
